Change Description
==================

The ACIS Ops Check_Power_Cmds.py checks the timing between ACISPKT
commands in the backstop file being reviewed. The rule which checks to
see if more than an hour has gone by after all FEPS have been turned
off, and any other FEPS turned on was firing erroneously. The rule
still correctly flagged timing errors when they did occur.  But it
also erroneously flagged an error.  This fix solves that

Testing:
======== 

 Tests were run on 8 loads with a version of the ACIS Ops LR software
 modified to execute the modified Check_Power_Cmds program:

      1) APR0819T Test Load                       Erroneous error flaged - fixed
      2) JAN1918A/B (TOO)                         No errors in load - none flagged
      3) SEP1317A/B (SCS-107 RTS load)            3 errors expected and detected
      4) MAR1117A   (STOP)                        4 Errors expected and detected
      5) APR0918A   (Normal)                      No errors in load - none flagged
      6) DEC2418A/B (Normal)                      Erroneous error flagged - fixed
      7) JUN1019A   (Normal)                      Erroneous error flagged - fixed
      8) ERROR_MAR0518 load                       All errors detected
           - Modified MAR0518 with all possible errors introduced


 The 8th load is a copy of the MAR0518 Normal load whose backstop file
 was modified to generate all possible timing errors. The tar file
 was copied, untarred, the backstop file modified, and the tarball
 re-created with the new backstop file.

 Resultant Load Review output using Check_Power_commands was compared
 against the original load review output.

  All tests PASSED.
