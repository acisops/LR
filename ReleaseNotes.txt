Change Description
==================

history-files.pl is an ACIS Ops program which is run during various
shutdown events (e.g. NSM, BSH, SCS-107).  A previous update recorded
these events in the Non-Load Event Tracking file. 

In the case of a Full Stop (both vehicle and science loads stopped)
event, the user is now asked whether or not the event is a Normal Sun
Mode Event (NSM).  If the answer is yes, then the user is prompted to
enter the present values of the 4 spacecraft quaternions.  A line entry in the
Non-Load Event Tracking file is entered recording the fact that the
spacecraft has maneuvered to the Normal Sun Mode pitch of 90 degrees. 

This change makes the entry of the maneuver to 90 degrees pitch more
automatic since ACIS Ops must run history-files.pl as soon as possible after
a shut down (the moment the OCC supplies the accurate shutdown time). 

Quaternions are obtained from one of the ACIS Ops 4 R/T web pages or
the two MTA Chandra State of Health Web pages:

Testing:
========

The software requires that the user answer either y (yes) n (no) or
RETURN when asked if this is a Normal Sun Mode event. No other response
is allowed. If the user types RETURN it's taken as a No.

The tests covered the various possible user responses to queries ("u"
was used to represent a keystroke other than y or n).

Tests done with both capital and lower case Y's and N's


NSM? RETURN - PASS
NSM? N      - PASS
NSM? u, N   - PASS
NSM? u, Y   - PASS

When the user indicates that this is an NSM event, the user is
prompted to enter the 4 present Quaternions.  The user can either
enter the proper Quaternion or hit return if they user does not know
one or more. 

NSM? y - Correct Q's 066 - PASS
     y - Q1 bogus    066 - PASS
     y - Q2 bogus    066 - PASS
     y - Q3 bogus    066 - PASS
     y - Q4 bogus    066 - PASS
     y - all bogus   066 - PASS

Deployment:
===========

Immediately after approval.
