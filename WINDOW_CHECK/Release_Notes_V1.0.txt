Change Description
==================

When SI mode CC_00170 was built to observer specifications, the window
configuration was in error. Specifically, 3 out of 4 chips in the SI
mode had window specifications which prevented any event from getting
through:

  windows[0] = {
    ccdId                    = 5
    ccdColumn                = 0
    width                    = 1023
    sampleCycle              = 0
    lowerEventAmplitude      = 1645
    eventAmplitudeRange      = 1305
  }
  windows[1] = {
    ccdId                    = 6
    ccdColumn                = 0
    width                    = 1023
    sampleCycle              = 0
    lowerEventAmplitude      = 1664
    eventAmplitudeRange      = 1287
  }
  windows[2] = {
    ccdId                    = 7
    ccdColumn                = 0
    width                    = 767
    sampleCycle              = 0
    lowerEventAmplitude      = 52
    eventAmplitudeRange      = 2897
  }
  windows[3] = {
    ccdId                    = 8
    ccdColumn                = 0
    width                    = 1023
    sampleCycle              = 0
    lowerEventAmplitude      = 1664
    eventAmplitudeRange      = 1287
  }

Window_Check.py scans all the SI modes used within a weekly
load; identifies whether or not any SI mode contains windows, and if
so, checks the windows for incorrect configuration:

If there is one window for a chip, the program checks to be sure the
configuration does not prevent all events from getting through (e.g. see Windows[3]
above).

Sometimes more than one window can be applied to a single chip within
an SI mode.  In that case all but the last window is checked to be
sure the configuration does not prevent any event from getting through.
