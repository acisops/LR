Change Description
==================

The ACIS Ops Check Power Commands program checks the timing of ACIS
power commands in the review backstop file. 

The ACIS Ops Check_Power_Cmds.py program has a rule that checks to 
see if the time gap between an ACIS WSPOWXXXXX command  and the next 
ACIS command is at least 63 seconds. If less than 63 seconds 
a message is written to the load review output file.

The rule was erroneously firing on time deltas just under 62.99999
seconds. The rule would not miss any real errors, but was throwing
errors that ought not be thrown. This was fixed.

Also, the code was adjusted so that it can be invoked via python3.


Files Changed:
==============

The important change occurred in Rulesets.py. There was also a minor 
change to an informational entry in the rules-fired list. 
VERSION file was updated to 1.5

BackstopFile_Class.py contains a more informative print statement.

Testing:
======== 

 Tests were run on 8 load weeks with a version of the ACIS Ops LR software
 modified to execute the modified Check_Power_Cmds program:

      1) APR0819T Test Load   Hand edited to generate all possible errors; all errors detected

      2) MAR1117A             4 Errors expected; 4 detected
      3) SEP1317A             No errors expected; none detected
      4) SEP1317B             3 errors expected; 3 detected
      5) DEC2418A             2 expected; 2 flagged
      6) DEC2418B             No errors expected; none detected
      7) SEP2120A             No errors in load - none flagged                
      8) FEB2221AA            No errors in load
                              3 Erroneous 63 second violation errors with old code
                              No errors flagged with new code

 The APR0819T load is a copy of the APR0819 Normal load whose backstop file
 was hand modified to generate all possible timing errors. The tar file
 was copied, untarred, the backstop file modified, and the tarball
 re-created with the new backstop file.

 Resultant Load Review output using Check_Power_commands was compared
 against the original load review output.

  All tests PASSED.
