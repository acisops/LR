Change Description
==================

The ACIS Ops Load Review software (lr) was modified to issue the command
line which executes the Check_Power_Cmds.py program using Python3.

Also, as a convenience to ACIS Ops, Every time lr is run on a weekly load
(e.g. FEB2221A) it will save the production NonLoadTrackedEvents.txt file
to a "dated" version (e.g. FEB2221A_NonLoadTrackedEvents.txt) in the directory:  

/data/acis/LoadReviews/TEST_NLET_FILES

This facilitates testing old load weeks using the NonLoadTrackedEvents.txt that
was existent at the time the load was reviewed for production.

Testing:
======== 

The change was tested by running the APR0819T load which
is a version of the APR0819A load which was hand edited 
to generate all power command errors that Check_Power_Cmds.py
tests for. It was run in both a production mode as well as 
a test mode to assure that the dated NLET file is created
only when lr is run in production mode and only using the
production NLET file.

  All tests PASSED.
