Change Description
==================

The ACIS Ops Check_Power_Cmds.py program checks the timing of ACIS
power commands in the review backstop file. 

ACIS Ops used to require that if a WSPOW00000 command was issued, 
and no other power command followed within one hour, then a WSPOW0002A 
shall be issued no later than 1 hour after the WSPOW00000. This is 
to keep the msid 1DPAMZT from cooling below 12 degrees C

The ACIS Ops Check_Power_Cmds.py program had a rule that checked to 
see if the time gap between a WSPOW00000 and the next power command
was greater than an hour and if so, issued a message in the ACIS load 
review output file.

Recently, FOTMP changed their algorithm to tracking the temperatures 
during a load and only issued the WSPOW0002A if the model showed 1DPAMZT 
cooling below 12 degrees C.

Therefore the rule was eliminated from the Check Power Commands code.

The important change occurred in Rulesets.py. There was also a minor 
change to an informational entry in the rules-fired list. 
VERSION file was updated to 1.5

BackstopFile_Class.py contains a more informative print statement.

Testing:
======== 

 Tests were run on 13 load weeks with a version of the ACIS Ops LR software
 modified to execute the modified Check_Power_Cmds program:

      1) APR0819T Test Load   Hand edited to generate all possible errors; all errors detected
      2) MAR1117A             4 Errors expected; 4 detected
      3) SEP1317A             No errors expected; none detected
      4) SEP1317B             3 errors expected; 3 detected
      5) JAN1918A             No errors in load - none flagged
      6) MAR0518A             No errors in load - none flagged     
      7) MAR0518B             No errors in load - none flagged     
      8) APR0918A             No errors in load - none flagged
      9) DEC2418A             2 expected; 2 flagged
     10) DEC2418B             3 examples of the WSPOW0-WSPOW02A errors no longer flagged.
                                  - Due to this s/w modification.
     11) JUN1019A             No errors in load - none flagged                
     12) SEP2120A             No errors in load - none flagged 

 The APR0819T load is a copy of the APR0819 Normal load whose backstop file
 was hand modified to generate all possible timing errors. The tar file
 was copied, untarred, the backstop file modified, and the tarball
 re-created with the new backstop file.

 Resultant Load Review output using Check_Power_commands was compared
 against the original load review output.

  All tests PASSED.
