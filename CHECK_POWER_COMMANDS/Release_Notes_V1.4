Change Description
==================

The ACIS Ops Check_Power_Cmds.py checks the timing of ACISPKT
commands in the backstop file being reviewed. The results were written
to a copy of the standard ACIS Load Review output file
(ACIS-LoadReview.txt) called ACIS-LoadReview.txt.ERRORS.  

A comparison was made of the two lr output files:

    ACIS-LoadReview.txt 
    ACIS-LoadReview.txt.ERRORS (contains any timing errors)

...for every load executed this year. All differences between the two files
were understood. 

Therefore, the power command check code was modified to copy
ACIS-LoadReview.txt.ERRORS to ACIS-LoadReview.txt so that we have only
one file to check during load reviews.

As part of this change, the Check Power Commands code was upgraded to
Python 3.  This necessitated changes to accomodate differences between
Python 3 and Python 2 and a small change to lr which calls the check
power command code.

There were also minor changes such as comment typo corrections.

Testing:
======== 

 Tests were run on 13 load weeks with a version of the ACIS Ops LR software
 modified to execute the modified Check_Power_Cmds program:

      1) APR0819T Test Load                       Erroneous error flaged - fixed
      2) JAN1918A/B (TOO)                         No errors in load - none flagged
      3) SEP1317A/B (SCS-107 RTS load)            3 errors expected and detected
      4) MAR1117A   (STOP)                        4 Errors expected and detected
      5) APR0918A   (Normal)                      No errors in load - none flagged
      6) DEC2418A/B (Normal)                      Erroneous error flagged - fixed
      7) JUN1019A   (Normal)                      Erroneous error flagged - fixed
      8) ERROR_MAR0518 load                       All errors detected
           - Modified MAR0518 with all possible errors introduced
      9) AUG0519     (Normal)  
     10) AUG1219     (Normal)  
     11) AUG1919     (Normal)  
     12) AUG2619     (Normal)  
     13) SEP0219 A&B (Normal)

 The 8th load is a copy of the MAR0518 Normal load whose backstop file
 was modified to generate all possible timing errors. The tar file
 was copied, untarred, the backstop file modified, and the tarball
 re-created with the new backstop file.

 Resultant Load Review output using Check_Power_commands was compared
 against the original load review output.

  All tests PASSED.
